          <li>Solar panels are often installed badly.</li>
          <li>All the solar panels are made in China so there are few Australian jobs in solar.</li>

			<h1>What is Solar Power?</h1>
      <p style = "text-align: left">Solar power is energy created by the heat and light from the sun, which can convert into electricity in order to heat the air, water, or to create solar fuels like hydrogen. At the moment, there are two types of solar power technology: Solar photovoltaic, and Solar thermal.<br></br>

      <strong>Solar photovoltaic</strong> converts sunlight directly through semiconductor cell or solar PV cell. Solar PV panels are currently the most popular type of solar energy.<br></br>

      <strong>Solar thermal</strong> converts sunlight into heat and can be used to various purposes such as creating steam to make electricity or used to drive refrigeration cycle with solar-based cooling (Australian Renewable Energy Agency, 2020).<br></br>

      Australian continent has highest solar energy resources per square meter more than any other countries in the world. Australia receives an average of 58 million PJ (petajoule) of solar radiation per year, which is around 10,000 times larger than its total energy consumption (Geoscience Australia, n.d.).<br></br>

      In 2016 - 17, Solar PV generated 3.1% of Australia’s electricity with more than two million of Australian households (21%) that have rooftop solar PV installed (Australian Renewable Energy Agency, 2020).<br></br>

      In 2019, small-scale solar PV was generated 22.3% of total clean energy and produced 5.3% of Australia’s total electricity. There were 287,504 rooftop solar installations, and more than 2.5 million Australian households are using benefits of rooftop solar right now (Clean Energy Council, n.d.).<br></br>

      While electricity prices have been continued to skyrocket, solar panel has become more affordable with the price falling more than 75% since 2009, and 500 times cheaper that the first solar cells produced in mid-1950s. Although there were less than 100,000 households installed with solar panel in 2008, there were more than two million rooftops solar installed in the last decade making Australia a number one in the world when it comes to rooftop solar. This fact makes the future of solar energy in Australia looking very bright and strong (Solar Citizens, n.d.).</p>
